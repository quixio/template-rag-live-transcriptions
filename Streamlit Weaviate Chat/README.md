# Weaviate Chat UI

A chat UI that uses RAG to provide the relevant context to the LLM based on results retrieved from a Weaviate vector DB.

I appropriated the code from this repo: https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-langchain-rag.git 
(it was originally designed to load local files and ingest them into a local vector DB but I updated it to use Weaviate Cloud)

There is still a lot of unnecessary code that I need to strip out.
