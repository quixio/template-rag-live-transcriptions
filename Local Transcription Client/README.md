# Transcribe your speech in real time and send it to local or Quix Kafka

This app uses the speechmatics API to transcribe your speech in real time and uses the Quix Streams Python client to send the text fragments to Quix.

It is not supposed to be a Quix service, rather it should run on your local machine only. 

You can get a free Speechmatics API key here: https://page.speechmatics.com/portal-signup.html
